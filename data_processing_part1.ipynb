    "### Advanced Statistics\n",
    "For each NBA season beginning with 2000 and ending with 2023, every team's advanced statistics is scraped from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com) and collected into a Pandas dataframe. This dataframe is passed through a function that cleans the data and prepares it for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced statistics do not include basic 3-point shooting data, but it will be used in the analysis. Therefore, the 3-point data will have to be collected separately using the same process and merged with the advanced statistics dataset. For the sake of organization and to work around the *Too Many Requests* error when scraping the data, this process will be performed in a separate notebook."
