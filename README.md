### Description
The advanced team statistics for each NBA team every season from 2000 to 2023 were collected and analyzed in order to find the most common factors among the champions each season. An exploratory data analysis was conducted using visualizations created in Tableau. The data was scraped from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) using a Python function to collect each teams's advanced statistics for each season from 2000 to 2023, where it was cleaned and exported to an Excel file using Python. The results of the analysis were reported as a datastory using a Google Site (link above).
